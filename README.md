<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>About Flare</h2>
Flare is a lightweight and modern CSS library that allows you to create responsive layouts with less code, gives you more sizing options and features automatic responsiveness, all without restricting your code.
<h2>Automatic Responsiveness and Manual Responsiveness</h2>
<p>
Flare can handle responsiveness automatically but also gives you the option to manually control it.
</p>
<p>When creating a layout, you have the option to define all column sizes on certain breakpoints, or to define the column sizes only on computer and let Flare handle the sizes on other breakpoints, or to combine both and let Flare handle sizes but overwrite them on certain breakpoints.</p>

<h2>Block layout and Flex layout</h2>
<p>Flare adds features so you can make different types of layouts that are not supported on other frameworks. You can build with block layout or flex layout depending on your needs and you can also combine both, using only the parts that you need of each one, or adding extra features with tags. The features are not limited to containers either, they can be applied to collumns (grow, stretch, fill, auto, etc) </p>

<h2>More Containers</h2>
<p>Flare gives you many options for different sized containers, letting you choose between automatic containers: container (normal), fluid, small, medium, one - sixteen and manual containers with customizable sizes on each breakpoint <code>[breakpoint]-size-[one..sixteen]</code>.</p>

<h2>Light & Fast code, Faster workflows</h1>
<p>Flare's main objective is to allow you to build websites faster, with shorter and lighter code and without restricting your coding and being highly customizable. </p>

<h2>Better Tablet responsiveness</h2>
<p>Flare adapts container sizes so items look better on tablets and small computers.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>the breakpoints are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>m (mobile)</li>
  <li>t (tablet)</li>
  <li>c (computer)</li>
  <li>lg</li>
  <li>xl</li>
  <li>xxl</li>
</ul>
<code>
@media(max-width:768px) {
}
</code>
<code>
@media(min-width:768px) and (max-width:900px){
}
</code>
<code>
@media(min-width:901px) and (max-width:1149px){
}
</code>
<code>
@media(min-width:1150px) and (max-width:1649px){
}
</code>
<code>
@media(min-width:1650px) and (max-width:2999px){
}
</code>
<code>
@media(min-width:3000px){
}
</code>
<h2>Column</h2>
<p>
A column can have a size of one to sixteen, *one* being 6.25% of the
container, *eight* being 50%, *sixteen* being 100% and so on.
</p>
<h4>Manual Responsiveness</h4>
<p>You define the sizes of the columns on each device by using the tags m (mobile), t (tablet), c (computer). <code>[breakpoint]-(one..sixteen)</code></p>
<p>For each breakpoint you choose, the size you set counts for the breakpoint and up. Example: <code>t-ten</code> will mean the column will have size 10 on tablets and up.</p>

<h4>Automatic Responsiveness</h4>
<p>When giving a column a certain size <code>column eight</code> , you tell flare that you want it's size to be eight (half) at a computer screen, and flare will handle responsiveness on tablet and mobile.</p>
<p>If you dont like the result on a certain screen size, you can always add a extra modifier <code>column eight t&#8209;twelve</code> &#8209; Flare will handle on mobile, but on tablet it will have the size of twelve</p>
Example:<code>column four</code> The column will have a size of four on computer and on the other sizes flare will handle it. <br><code>column four t-three</code> The column will have a size of four on computer, on tablet only it will have a size of three and on other sizes flare will handle it.

<p>To combine automatic with manual responsiveness, you can choose automatic responsiveness and then overwrite it on specific breakpoints.</p>
<br> <code>column eight t-eight</code> means that flare will handle responsiveness on all devices except tablets, where the column will take the size of eight.
<P>When using breakpoints in combination with automatic responsiveness, breakpoints no longer count for themselves and up, they count only for themselves. Example: <code>column twelve t-sixteen</code> instead of t-sixteen counting for tablet and up, it will only give the column size 16 at tablet.</P>

<h4>Equal Size</h4>
<p>You can also set the sizes of columns by adding equal-size-[one..sixteen] to its container. It means that all containers inside of the container will have the size of [one...sixteen] unless overwritten on the column tag.
<p>Equal Size can have breakpoints (manual) or it can be used without breakpoints (automatic responsiveness).
<br>
Automatic Responsiveness (three columns per line on computer and flare handles the size on other screens)
  
```
<div class="container equal-three">
  <div class="column"></div>
  <div class="column"></div>
  <div class="column"></div>
</div>
```

Manual Responsiveness (three columns per line on size mobile and up)

```
<div class="container m-equal-three">
  <div class="column"></div>
  <div class="column"></div>
  <div class="column"></div>
</div>
```

<p>Using the tag <code>column</code> is not obligatory, but it's ideal for easy CSS targeting. You can change it for any name you like, just keep it consistant!</p>

<p>Main sizing tags for columns: number*, equal-number*, equal*</p>
<p>Main alignment tags for columns: first*, last*, self-left, self-right, self-top, self-bottom, self-middle, stretch, grow, shrink</p>

* = has breakpoints (m- t- c- lg- xl- xxl-), if using not using breakpoint then flare handles its responsiveness

<h1>Row & Flexbox</h1>
<p>Rows & Flexboxes are used to set items side by side.</p>
<p>You can add a size to the row to limit the total size of the content, centralizing it in the screen.</p>

<p>Inside of rows, columns behave with a block behavior.</p>
<p>Inside of flexbox, columns behave with a flex behavior.</p>
<h4>Block default behavior: </h4>
  Collumns will have defined sizes that will not grow (nogrow). <br>
  Columns in a line not have the same vertical size (nostretch). <br>
  Columns overflowing will jump to the next line (multiline).<br>


<h4>Flex default behavior: </h4>
  Collumns are sized acording to the size of their content (auto). <br>
  Columns in a line have the same vertical size (stretch). <br>
  Columns will grow to fill all empty space (grow). <br>
  Columns will shrink to fit in one line (singleline).</p><br>
  
<p>All default behaviors can be overwritten with tags (grow, shrink, multiline, auto, number, equal, etc...)</p>

Container Sizes: container, fluid, small, medium, size-number*
<br>
Overwrite behavior tags: grow, stretch, shrink, singleline, multiline, size-number*, equal*, equal-number*
<br>
* = has breakpoints (m- t- c- lg- xl- xxl-), if using not using breakpoint then flare handles its responsiveness

<h2>More Examples</h2>
<h3>A row + container whos columns have the size of one third on computer and on other screens flare handles sizes</h3>

```
<div class="row container equal-three">
    <div class="column"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
</div>
```

<h3>A row + container whos columns have the size of one third on tablet and up, and the first column has a size of 100% on tablet and up</h3>

```
<div class="row container t-equal-three">
    <div class="column t-sixteen"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
</div>
```

<h3>A row + container whos columns have the size of one fourth on computer and flare will handle responsiveness on other screens (equal-three), but the columns will be forced have the size of third of width on tablet (t-equal-three), and the first column will have a size of 100% on tablet (t-sixteen)</h3>

```
<div class="row container equal-four t-equal-three">
    <div class="column t-sixteen"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
    <div class="column"></div>
</div>
```
