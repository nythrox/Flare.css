<h2>About Flare</h2>
Flare is a lightweight and modern CSS library that allows you to create responsive layouts with less code, gives you more sizing options and features automatic responsiveness, all without restricting your code.
<h2>Automatic Responsiveness and Manual Responsiveness</h2>
<p>
Flare can handle responsiveness automatically but also gives you the option to manually control it.
</p>
<p>When creating a layout, you have the option to define all column sizes on certain breakpoints, or to define the column sizes only on computer and let Flare handle the sizes on other breakpoints, or to combine both and let Flare handle sizes but overwrite them on certain breakpoints.</p>

<h2>Block layout and Flex layout</h2>
<p>Flare adds features so you can make different types of layouts that are not supported on other frameworks. You can build with block layout or flex layout depending on your needs and you can also combine both, using only the parts that you need of each one, or adding extra features with tags. The features are not limited to containers either, they can be applied to collumns (grow, stretch, fill, auto, etc) </p>

<h2>More Containers</h2>
<p>Flare gives you many options for different sized containers, letting you choose between automatic containers: container (normal), fluid, small, medium, one - sixteen and manual containers with customizable sizes on each breakpoint <code>[breakpoint]-size-[one..sixteen]</code>.</p>

<h2>Light & Fast code, Faster workflows</h1>
<p>Flare's main objective is to allow you to build websites faster, with shorter and lighter code and without restricting your coding and being highly customizable. </p>

<h2>Better Tablet responsiveness</h2>
<p>Flare adapts container sizes so items look better on tablets and small computers.</p>
